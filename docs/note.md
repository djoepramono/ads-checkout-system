# Note

Not sure how to extends a union?
You can't. You can only extend an interface thus just create a data property that contain that union

When a function needs to be executed after a function, write a bigger function and test it.

Sometimes Jest Typescript doesn't really get updated propertly when watching , especially when you move interface around to different files

Which function goes to which file?
Each data type goes into its own file
Each function that use the data type AND return primitive type can be put into the bespoke file
